    This is XMMS-Shell, a simple command-line utility for controlling XMMS.
It provides every command-line feature the xmms command provides, plus a
few others:

      * Volume control
      * Equalizer control
      * Control over display of main, equalizer, and playlist windows
      * Can pop up the preferences or file load dialogs
      * A few miscellaneous but potentially useful commands, such as FADE,
        FAKEPAUSE, and RESETDEVICE

    The 0.99 series of XMMS-Shell represents a complete rewrite of the 0.2
series.  All of the functionality of 0.2 should still be provided.  The 0.99
series is considered beta.  Once the code is deemed stable, it will graduate
to version 1.0.  This code has barely been tested with XMMS 1.2.6, but it
should work with any version of XMMS after 1.0.
