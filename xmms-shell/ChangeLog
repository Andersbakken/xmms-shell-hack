  * Fixed a typo that caused downvolume to be the same as upvolume (copy and
    paste is a sign of poor design!)
  * The quit field of the CommandContext object is now explicitly
    initialize to false (why didn't g++ -Wall catch this?)
  * Implemented XMMSQUIT command (idea courtesy of Roderick Schertler)
  * include/playlist.h is now mentioned in include/Makefile.am
  * Implemented RANDOMTRACK command, with only a minor attempt at making it
    seem random.  Rather than hard-coding some behavior for the NEXT and
    PREVIOUS commands when shuffle-mode is on, RAND could be used instead.
  * Went ahead and hard-coded some behavior for the NEXT and PREVIOUS
    commands when shuffle-mode is on.  Note that this only works on versions
    of XMMS that provide xmms_remote_is_shuffle (I forget which version
    introduced this).  XMMS's support of this seems really poor, so maybe
    RANDOMTRACK is better.

  * Released as 0.99.0
  * Massively rewritten
    - Rewrote how commands are specified and how they provide help text
    - Implemented simple quoting in the command parser
    - If readline is enabled, filenames will be properly quoted
    - In the future, more complex scripting (rather than a simple batch
      mode) may be implemented, so command system redesigned to reflect this
    - All commands should now give some sort of feedback
    - All of the functionality of 0.2.2 should be emulated
