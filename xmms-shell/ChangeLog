  * Fixed error in reimplementation of the LOAD command
  * Fixed typo in reimplementation of the FADE command
  * Added delay in command evaluation loop, so that state changes to XMMS
    by XMMS-Shell commands can hopefully be reflected in the prompt
    accurately, but unfortunately this does not work
  * Fixed error in reimplementation of the WINDOW command
  * Added doc subdirectory, moved man page and HTML help there
  * Modified Makefiles so that documentation is included in the source
    distribution
  * Released as 0.99.3

  * Made changes to how script/interactive input is processed
  * Added simple customizable prompt support

Mon Oct 21 05:03:31 UTC 2002  Logan Hanks  <logan@vt.edu>

  * Abstracted the xmmsctrl API a tiny bit, which necessitated small changes
    in the implementation of every command.  Some time will be needed to
    locate and fix all the tiny bugs I may have introduced in the process.
  * Added Formatter class (untested currently)

Sat Oct 19 19:49:09 UTC 2002  Logan Hanks  <logan@vt.edu>

  * Added in long-awaited changes to make xmms-shell compile under g++ 3
    (patches from several sources)
  * Titles of tracks displayed by LIST are now aligned, and the current
    track is now marked (request #514146)
  * RANDOMTRACK renamed to RANDOM-TRACK (alias to RANDOMTRACK also added)
  * Added CURRENT-TRACK command (request #514146)
  * Added REMOVE command (request #514146)

Thu Oct 17 19:30:49 UTC 2002  Logan Hanks  <logan@vt.edu>

  * Released as 0.99.1
  * WINDOW SHOW now has the correct behavior (closes bug #583730)
  * FADE now advances to next track (closes Debian bug #120161)

  * Fixed a typo that caused downvolume to be the same as upvolume (copy and
    paste is a sign of poor design!)
  * The quit field of the CommandContext object is now explicitly
    initialize to false (why didn't g++ -Wall catch this?)
  * Implemented XMMSQUIT command (idea courtesy of Roderick Schertler)
  * include/playlist.h is now mentioned in include/Makefile.am
  * Implemented RANDOMTRACK command, with only a minor attempt at making it
    seem random.  Rather than hard-coding some behavior for the NEXT and
    PREVIOUS commands when shuffle-mode is on, RAND could be used instead.
  * Went ahead and hard-coded some behavior for the NEXT and PREVIOUS
    commands when shuffle-mode is on.  Note that this only works on versions
    of XMMS that provide xmms_remote_is_shuffle (I forget which version
    introduced this).  XMMS's support of this seems really poor, so maybe
    RANDOMTRACK is better.

Mon Feb 11 03:46:06 UTC 2002  Logan Hanks  <logan@vt.edu>

  * Released as 0.99.0
  * Massively rewritten
    - Rewrote how commands are specified and how they provide help text
    - Implemented simple quoting in the command parser
    - If readline is enabled, filenames will be properly quoted
    - In the future, more complex scripting (rather than a simple batch
      mode) may be implemented, so command system redesigned to reflect this
    - All commands should now give some sort of feedback
    - All of the functionality of 0.2.2 should be emulated


Thu May 18 02:46:59 UTC 2000  Logan Hanks  <logan@vt.edu>

  * Released as 0.2.2
  * Moved old changes to ChangeLog.old, switched to new format
  * Made more improvements to the installation process
  * Added resetdevice command
  * Added preamp and band commands (only available with a very
    recent copy of XMMS checked out from CVS)
